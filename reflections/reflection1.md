## Sprint 1 Reflection

My team's work this sprint aligned with my learning goals of better understanding networking concepts and the GNU C socket library.  The exercises associated with the HeadFirst C and ThinkOS readings most prepared me for the sprint review, although I believe that our team should have come together after completing them to review the material.  This would have helped us have a better grasp on the code walkthrough.  

We did not heavily adapt the eduScrum ceremonies during Sprint 1.  We have been using team meetings primarily for project work and planning.  Although these did involve learning C concepts together in order to understand networking, we did not cover the base material unless it was directly related to our project of building a server.  When we started the sprint, we did not have a clear idea of where we would be at the end, particularly whether we would have done mostly research or whether we would have started on a prototype.  After individually reading through *Beej's Guide to Network Programming* and Chapter 11 of HeadFirst C, we came together to answer each other's questions and walk through the "web_server" code from *Unix Networking Programming* by W. Richard Stevens.  This exercise, plus our talk with Allen to clarify how the server, client, and protocol fit together, was valuable for our understanding and gave us confidence that we have the tools to build our own prototype of a file-transfer server.

We realized near the end of the sprint that our stretch goal of writing a file-transfer server is likely more of a feasible MVP, but we have not yet defined a new stretch goal for the overall project.  We are considering exploring graphics to make a video-streaming server or similar.
